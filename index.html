                I'm a researcher with a background in AI. My goal is to use my skills to benefit the public and help non-profit organizations. My current focus is on forecasting methodologies at the Forecasting Research Institute (FRI), where I'm exploring how forecasting can enhance decision-making processes. I'm also diving deeper into the capabilities and implications of Large Language Models (LLMs). I will attend ARENA to further develop my technical skills LLM research.
            </p>
            <p>
                I've also worked on the intersection of AI and remote sensing — developing weakly supervised learning models that extract meaningful insights from satellite imagery. I'm excited about the potential of remote sensing to deliver positive societal impact.

        Continuing work developed for my MSc thesis, where I developed a weakly supervised model to automatically segment permafrost land structures from aerial images. This work enables efficient tracking of changes in permafrost areas in northern Scandinavia, a process previously done mostly manually.
